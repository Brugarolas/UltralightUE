# UltralightUE
Ultralight UI Support for Unreal Engine 5.2+.

This Project plans to be a framework for supporting Ultralight UI in Unreal Engine. 
IT IS NOT ready for shippable projects by any means, but support will be given to help with using the library. 

~~Currently, the project will be in full-swing once 1.3.0 stable is offically released by Ultralight Inc.~~

Current Supported Ultralight Version: 1.3.0 - development
# Unreal Versions

Currently, the plugin is being developed on 5.2, but there are plans to back port to UE 4.27 for wider use.

# Documentation

Documentation is currently being worked on, and will be linked at: (https://jailbreakpapa.github.io/UltralightUE.github.io/). 

# Supported Platforms

Currently Supported Platforms with the plugin are: Windows, Linux, and Mac. 

## Console Platforms

Console Platforms can work with minimal to no changes with the plugin, but it may require you to contact Ultralight Inc. to access those SDK's.
